# Point-Mutation-Generator
Simulate point mutations

This program was created using VB.Net.  You can simulate point mutations by placing a starting text in the textbox and then setting the parameters for the maximum number of mutations per generation and the maximum number of replications.  

Random mutations are added/subtracted/appended to the starting text and placed in a hierarchy tree in the treeview box.
